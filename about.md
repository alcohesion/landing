    The area of operation is Africa. It is about 11 Million sq mi with a population of about 1.4 Billion as of 2023. Some of the facts about Africa are:
    a) Africa is the second largest continent in the world and has more countries than Asia the largest continent in the world. The countries are: Algeria, Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, Reunion, Rwanda, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Sao Tome & Principe, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Western Sahara, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
    b) Africa is divided up into five sub-sections; North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa and West Africa. The entirety of Africa covers almost 10 million square miles which makes up more than 20% of the world’s land.
    c) There are many different languages spoken. The most widely spoken language here is Arabic (by 170 million people), followed by English (by 130 million people) then Swahili, French, Bereber, Hausa and Portuguese.
    d) Although Africa holds many different resources it is a continent where many of the countries have vast numbers of their populations living in poverty. This has led to 40% of adults in Africa being illiterate. The worst affected areas, with shocking illiteracy over 50% are in Ethiopia, Chad, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Niger, Benin and Burkina Faso.
    e) Africa is home to some great resources sought after by the Western world. Almost half of the gold ever mined on Earth has come from Africa, and more specifically, from Witwatersrand in South Africa. South Africa and Botwana has diamonds.
    f) Nobel Prizes have been received by Africans for exemplary duties. These include, Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Kofi Annan and the most recent Denis Mukwege.
    h) Africa is very behind the “digital divide” and there are more people in the one single city of New York with internet access than the entire continent and the 54 countries of Africa!
    i) Africa’s deforestation rate is twice the average rate for the rest of the world. There are four million hectares of forest destroyed each year and some countries here in Africa have less than 1% of primary forest remaining.
